                <p>Cosmetics were an essential part of daily life in Ancient Egypt, used by both men and women. Egyptians believed that makeup offered spiritual protection as well as physical enhancement. Kohl eyeliner, made from galena, was applied to define the eyes and guard against the harsh desert sun and evil spirits. Red ochre was used to color cheeks and lips, while malachite‚Äîa bright green mineral‚Äîwas worn as eyeshadow. Beauty routines were often linked to status and divinity, with depictions of deities and pharaohs frequently showing highly stylized, painted faces. Makeup was stored in ornate containers and applied with elegant tools, highlighting its cultural importance.</p>

                <h3>Greece & Rome</h3>
                <p>In Ancient Greece and Rome, cosmetics were used to enhance beauty and signify wealth and status. Beauty ideals often drew inspiration from mythological goddesses, who embodied perfection and divine femininity. Pale skin was highly valued in both cultures, achieved using white lead or chalk powders. Women applied red ochre or crushed berries to their cheeks and lips for a healthy flush, and used soot or kohl to darken their eyes and brows. Both civilizations favored a natural look but practiced elaborate beauty routines, especially in Rome, where perfumes and imported oils were popular. Despite their widespread use, cosmetics were sometimes criticized as signs of vanity or deception, especially in philosophical or moral writings.</p>

            <h2>Beauty at a Cost</h2>
            <p>Beauty standards throughout history have led to some startlingly unsafe trends. Many popular beauty products contained ingredients we now know to be hazardous. During the Renaissance, women applied Venetian ceruse, a white face paint made of lead and vinegar, which caused skin corrosion and chronic poisoning. In the 19th century, arsenic complexion wafers promised pale, ‚Äúperfect‚Äù skin‚Äîwhile slowly poisoning users. Even into the early 20th century, radioactive face creams were marketed as rejuvenating treatments. These dangerous trends reflect how far individuals were willing to go to meet society‚Äôs shifting beauty standards.</p>

            <h2>Safer Today? Modern Myths</h2>
            <p>Though today's beauty industry is more regulated, myths still thrive‚Äîespecially in the age of TikTok. "Clean beauty" is a popular marketing term, but it‚Äôs often misleading. Natural ingredients are not always safer, and synthetic doesn't necessarily mean harmful. In fact, natural ingredients like citrus oils or essential oils can cause irritation or allergic reactions, especially when exposed to sunlight. Influencers without scientific background often spread misinformation, encouraging unsafe DIY hacks that can harm skin and health. Despite advancements in cosmetic safety, consumers still need to remain vigilant, skeptical of viral trends, and prioritize safety over hype.</p>

            <h2>Then vs. Now: Cosmetic Safety Evolution</h2>
            <p>Today‚Äôs cosmetics industry looks very different from centuries past. Following several scandals‚Äîincluding the Lash Lure mascara incident in the 1930s, which caused blindness and even death‚Äîgovernments began regulating the beauty industry. The U.S. passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, granting the FDA authority over product safety. Now, ingredient lists are mandatory, and companies must adhere to strict safety and labeling standards. Global movements also push for cruelty-free testing and sustainable practices. While beauty trends continue to evolve, consumer safety and ethical concerns now play a central role in shaping what products make it onto store shelves.</p>

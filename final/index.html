                <h3>1920s: The Flapper Era</h3>
                <p>The 1920s saw a dramatic shift in both makeup and fashion, driven by a desire for <mark>freedom and rebellion</mark> against traditional norms. Makeup became more pronounced, featuring dark, smoky eyes with kohl eyeliner, thin eyebrows, dark red lips, and a pale complexion. Women embraced the flapper look, characterized by shorter, bobbed hair, drop-waist dresses, and shorter skirts. This style was inspired by actresses like Clara Bow and fashion icons like Coco Chanel, who popularized loose, straight silhouettes.</p>

                    <p>Modern nail polish was developed in the 1920s using nitrocellulose‚Äîthe same glossy, fast-drying formula found in car paint. It gave rise to the first-ever red polish: Revlon‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúCherries in the Snow.‚Äù</p>

            <h2>Beauty and Safety: Then and Now</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, beauty sometimes came at a <a href="cosmetics-history.html">dangerous cost</a>. In past centuries, lead-based powders, arsenic-laced skin lighteners, and mercury-infused creams were popular despite their toxicity. Even in the early 20th century, mascara formulas could cause blindness, and little regulation existed to protect consumers. The turning point came with public outcry and growing awareness of these health risks, prompting legislation like the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. Today, cosmetic safety is regulated in many countries, with strict ingredient testing, labeling laws, and banned substances. Modern beauty prioritizes transparency, science-backed formulations, and consumer education for safer self-expression.</p>

            <p>The foundation of today‚Äôs beauty products began in the early 20th century, when innovations in packaging and ingredients brought cosmetics into the mainstream. Mascara, originally sold as a cake applied with a brush, became more accessible with the invention of the tube wand in the 1950s. Lipstick, once reserved for stage actors, gained everyday appeal in the 1920s thanks to silent film stars and new swivel-up metal cases. By the mid-1900s, makeup was no longer taboo‚Äîit was a symbol of femininity, self-expression, and glamour. These developments laid the groundwork for the diverse and advanced beauty products we use today.</p>

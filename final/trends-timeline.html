            <h2>The Evolution of Beauty Standards</h2>
            <p>Beauty standards have constantly shifted in response to <mark>societal changes</mark>. In the 1920s, the flapper look, with short bobbed hair and bold makeup, was a radical departure from Victorian ideals.

            <h2>Cultural Shifts and Their Impact on Beauty Trends</h2>
            <p>Cultural events have always shaped beauty trends. During World War II, women's beauty became practical with short, simple hairstyles and minimal makeup. The feminist movement in the 1970s challenged traditional beauty ideals, promoting natural beauty and personal freedom. In contrast, the 1980s celebrated maximalism, powered by music videos and celebrity culture. In the digital age, social media influencers and filters created a new beauty standard emphasizing flawless skin and symmetrical features. Today, movements focused on inclusivity and representation are reshaping beauty trends, highlighting diversity and individual expression.</p>

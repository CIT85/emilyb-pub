            <h2>Gen Z's Beauty Philosophy</h2>    
            <p>For Gen Z, beauty is a space to explore identity, creativity, and mood rather than a set of rules. Rather than adhering to narrow standards of attractiveness, Gen Z celebrates individuality, diversity, and authenticity. This generation embraces all skin tones, genders, and body types, often using makeup and skincare as tools for self-expression rather than conformity. Ethical considerations—such as sustainability, cruelty-free testing, and mental health—play a significant role in product choices. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram have democratized trendsetting, allowing everyday users to influence beauty norms once dominated by celebrities and legacy fashion magazines.</p>

                <h3>Skin-First Minimalism</h3>
                <p>Minimalist beauty, popularized by Gen Z through the “clean girl” aesthetic, emphasizes natural features, healthy skin, and a subtle glow. This approach favors natural skin textures, subtle highlights, brushed-up brows, and soft neutral tones. It aligns with Gen Z’s skincare-first mindset and growing interest in wellness and authenticity. Rather than masking imperfections, minimalist routines aim to enhance natural features with intention and care. Products like tinted moisturizers, cream blushes, and multi-use balms are staples. This aesthetic is both practical and aspirational, offering a polished yet approachable appearance that fits seamlessly into daily life.</p>

                <h3>Playful Maximalism</h3>
                <p>In contrast, maximalist beauty represents a bold, expressive, and often artistic approach to makeup. Inspired by media like HBO’s <em>Euphoria</em>, this aesthetic embraces vibrant eyeshadows, graphic eyeliner, rhinestones, and dramatic embellishments. Rather than enhancing features subtly, maximalist looks celebrate creativity, often transforming the face into a canvas for storytelling. Influences include rave culture, drag performance, Y2K nostalgia, and fantasy elements. For Gen Z, maximalist makeup is a form of self-definition and rebellion against conventional beauty norms. It thrives in online spaces, where tutorials and trend cycles foster rapid innovation and widespread participation.</p>

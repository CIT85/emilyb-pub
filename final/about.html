            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Beauty Trends Through Time</strong>, a creative project exploring the evolution of makeup and fashion trends from the past to today. This site was created to combine my passion for beauty, history, and design into a space that's fun, informative, and visually engaging.</p>
            <h3>Who Is This Site For?</h3>
            <p>This site is for makeup enthusiasts who want to understand the roots of today's trends, students or researchers interested in fashion and cultural history, and anyone who's curious about how style has dramatically transformed over time. Whether you're here for nostalgia, learning, or inspiration, there's something for you.</p>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>I was inspired by my love of makeup and how its not just a form of self-expression, but also an artistic medium. Beauty trends fascinate me, especially how they evolve over time, mirroring changes in media, technology, and society. I believe that style and beauty are deeply personal and reflect your culture and identity. This site is a celebration of how people across generations have used fashion and makeup to express who they are, and how those choices continue to influence the world around us.</p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>In the future, I would add JavaScript and more advanced CSS to create an interactive timeline or image gallery. I could also expand the content to include things like tutorials on how to achieve a certain look.</p>
